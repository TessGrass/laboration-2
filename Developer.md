# **For Developers**

For those of you who are developers and curious about how the application works, here is an overview of the application and its structure.

## **Motivation**
With today's electricity market in mind, this application was created as a tool for users who want to get tomorrow's hourly electricity prices. Furthermore, the data retrieved can be used to optimize electricity consumption in homes or in an application for visualize tomorrow's hourly price. By gaining an insight into when electricity is most expensive, this can help redirect consumption to hours when the price is lower and thus help lower electricity costs for people in their homes.
<br>

## **How does it work**
The application is built on a module that retrieves tomorrow's electricity prices via NordPool's API and can therefore be seen as the cogwheel for almost the entire application. The application is based on the MVC pattern and the module is therefore not dependent on the application to function. The module is also not included when the application is cloned down so you need to clone it seperatly from its own repo. You can also clone the module and build your own interface according to your own goals and ideas.

## **The Module**
The Module can be found here [Module Repo](https://github.com/TessGrass/laboration-1)<br>
The Module readme can be found here [Module Readme](https://github.com/TessGrass/laboration-1/blob/main/README.md)<br>
The Module test report can be found here [Module Test Report](https://github.com/TessGrass/laboration-1/blob/main/test-rapport/Testrapport.md)
<br>

## **Application**
Current status: ACTIVE<br>
The application has been tested against the requirements stated here [Application Requirements](https://github.com/TessGrass/laboration-2/issues)<br> 
The tests and its current status can be found here [Application Test Report](./Testrapport.md)<br>

## **Vision**
The vision for the application is that it should continue to develop and benefit more people. Some of the implementations that are planned are the following:<br>
* Implement two language option (Swedish and English)<br>
* Implement the sorting ability that is currently on hold
